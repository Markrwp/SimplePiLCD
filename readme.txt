# SimplePiLCD
A simple scrolling display of BBC News on a RPi with a 16x2 LCD, made by a newbie coder. (Please forgive any errors!).
Program works on my RPi Zero with a 16x2 lcd.
Ensure you have all libraries in Python 3 available (open file with nano and see notes after shebang).
Make use of and modify the program in any way you want.
This program is intended to help those who, like me, are frustrated by the lack of good, working examples on the net of a simple scrolling lcd news ticker.
The program was made by adapting bits and pieces from the codes of others cited in the acknowledgements. 
Parts of their codes, such as splitting texts or using "autoscroll", would not work for me, so they are edited out.
A big "thank you" to Didac Garcia, whose example of a simple infinite loop in lines 49-55 of his/her "Demo Scrolling LCD" were invaluable.
